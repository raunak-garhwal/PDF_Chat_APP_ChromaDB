# PDF Chat Application with Cohere and ChromaDB

A Streamlit web application that allows users to upload PDFs and ask questions about their content using Large Language Models.


## Features

- üìÑ PDF file upload and text extraction
- üîç Text chunking and embedding with Cohere
- üíæ Vector storage using ChromaDB
- üí¨ Question answering with semantic search
- üåê Interactive web interface built with Streamlit

## How It Works

1. **Extract Text**: Extracts text from the uploaded PDF document using PyMuPDF
2. **Chunk Text**: Divides the text into manageable chunks (default size: 500 words)
3. **Create Embeddings**: Transforms chunks into vector embeddings using Cohere's embed-v4.0 model
4. **Store Vectors**: Stores vector embeddings in ChromaDB for semantic search
5. **Query Processing**: Embeds user questions and finds relevant document chunks
6. **Answer Generation**: Uses Cohere's command-r-plus-08-2024 model to generate answers based on retrieved context

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Streamlit
- PyMuPDF
- Cohere Python SDK
- ChromaDB
- pysqlite3-binary
- protobuf==4.23.3
- streamlit-lottie

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PDF_Chat_APP_ChromaDB.git
cd PDF_Chat_APP_ChromaDB

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run pdf-app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501

3. Upload a PDF file through the interface

4. Enter your question about the PDF content

5. View the generated answer based on the document's content

## Development Environment

This project includes a devcontainer configuration for VS Code and GitHub Codespaces, which provides:

- Python 3.11 environment
- Automatic installation of dependencies
- Pre-configured Streamlit server
- Port forwarding for the web application

## Configuration

The application uses the following default settings:

- Chunk size: 500 words
- Embedding model: Cohere's embed-v4.0
- Generative model: Cohere's command-r-plus-08-2024
- Cohere API key (included in the code for demo purposes - in production, use environment variables)
